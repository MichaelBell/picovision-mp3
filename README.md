# PicoVision Bluetooth MP3 Player

Bluetooth MP3 player for PicoVision, complete with an FFT display of the music.

This pulls together the Bluetooth audio source example, the [SDIO SD card library](https://github.com/carlk3/no-OS-FatFS-SD-SDIO-SPI-RPi-Pico) by carlk3 and an [MP3 wrapper library](https://github.com/ikjordan/picomp3lib/) from ikjordan, which is based on an Adafruit wrapper of the RealNetworks helix mp3 library.
